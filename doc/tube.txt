1. Overview                                                    *tube-overview*


This plugin provide a tiny interface for sending commands from MacVim to a 
separate iTerm or Terminal window.

    eg. :Tube cd .. & python run_tests.py


==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                            *tube-requirements*

* Mac OS X 10.6+ (note that this plugin has been tested only on Mac OS X 10.6
  but should work even with successive versions)
* iTerm2 or Terminal installed
* Vim compiled with python 2.x+     


3. Aliasing                                                    *tube-aliasing*
==============================================================================

With this functionality you can define your own aliases for commands easily.
This might be useful when you often work with long commands easily forgettable.
You can define an alias at run time or in your directly .vimrc. In the latter
case your aliases can persist as long as you like while in the former the alias
remains available only for the vim session in which it was defined. 


==============================================================================
4. Commands                                                    *tube-commands*


Tube                                                                    *Tube*
> arguments: a string of any length
> e.g. Tube python % (see below for the special % character)


Execute the command in the separate iTerm (or Terminal) window. If the that
window does not exist yet, then it is created. If no command is given the the
window is simply created, or cleared if it already exists. By default the
window focus remains on MacVim but you can customize this behavior (see the
g:tube_run_command_background setting).

As you see there is no need of quotes around the command, but if you need these
in your command be sure to use double quotes. 

The character % has a special meaning: as in the vim command line it is
expanded to the current buffer name. If you need that character in your command
use the %% sequence (actually, every sequence made of two or more %s will
be reduced to just one % character. See the g:tube_percent_sign_expansion 
setting to customize this behavior).
